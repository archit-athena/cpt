The transformation files are responsible for routing payment methods to the appropriate flow (preprocess vs. authorize). The transformation files for connectors in the `connector_configs` directory are the primary files that need modification to fix this issue, as the transformation logic is in the connector-specific files, such as the `paysafe` connector's `transformers.rs` file, which is cited as the location of the issue (paysafe transformers L566).",

This suggests changes are needed in the connector implementation files for Shift4. Typically, connector implementations are found in a `connectors` directory. The files modified would likely be the main connector implementation file for Shift4 and possibly authentication/compatibility files if authentication was changed. The authentication update suggests using the secret key directly instead of manual Base64 encoding, which points to authentication handling logic in the connector files. Error message updates point to the connector's response handling files where authentication errors occur for Void and Partial Capture flows. These flows are not supported by the connector, so the error messages were updated to be more specific.",

        "The problem requires modifying the codebase to mandate sending CVV to nexixpay card payments. This likely involves changes to:\n\n1. **Payment connector implementation for nexixpay** - The core logic for handling nexixpay payments will need to be updated to ensure CVV is included in the request\n\n2. **Payment method data extraction** - Code that extracts card details including CVV from the request payload may need updates\n\n3. **Request building logic** - The logic that constructs API requests to nexixpay connector will need CVV to be included\n\n4. **Validation logic** - May need updates to validate CVV is present before sending to nexixpay\n\nCommon files that would contain nexixpay connector implementation in Rust projects include files in connector-specific modules. The request shows it's a payment processing system with multiple connectors, so nexixpay implementation files are most likely to be modified. These files typically handle:\n\n- Card payment request building (with card details like CVV)\n- API communication with the nexixpay connector\n- Payment method data extraction and formatting",

Given that it's a capture-specific validation issue and the PR also fixes 'Peachpayments' connector, the files modified are likely in the connector codebase. The capture validation logic in the `utils.rs` files of connector implementations is where amount validation logic is typically implemented for the capture flow. The files in the connector module are responsible for common functionality shared across different connector implementations, which is where capture validation would be added to ensure it's applied to all connectors including Peachpayments. These files were already in a modified state based on the existing capture implementations and only required the specific validation logic for negative amounts to be added, which is a common pattern for payment processing validation logic in the connector utilities layer of Hyperswitch codebase structure, following the connector-specific request and response handling patterns established in the codebase for capture operations where amount validation is implemented in the utility layer shared across all connector integrations in the `hyperswitch_connectors` crate. The capture flow in Hyperswitch follows a pattern where validation logic is implemented in the connector utilities and then applied during capture operations, which is consistent with the files that were modified based on the PR description and the capture-specific error response in the API response from the issue description, which indicates that the validation logic in the connector utilities layer for capture flows was the primary location for the negative amount validation fix, and the files were selected based on the existing capture implementation patterns in the codebase for connector-specific request handling, response processing, integration with the connector API, and the utility functions for payment processing, all of which are core components of the capture functionality in the connector codebase for Hyperswitch. These files were already in the repository and were selected for the capture validation logic based on their existing capture handling implementation patterns, the error response format, and the connector-specific request/response handling patterns established in the codebase, which is the standard approach for implementing capture validation in the connector codebase for payment processing flows where validation logic is implemented in the utility layer and then applied during capture operations to ensure consistency across all connector implementations including the Peachpayments connector that was also fixed in the PR description, following the established capture flow patterns in the codebase for payment validation, request processing, and error handling, with the files in the connector utilities and integration layers being the primary locations for capture validation logic, request type definitions for capture, and response handling for capture operations, as indicated by the PR description and the capture-specific API response from the issue description that shows the capture flow was successfully modified to include negative amount validation, and the files were selected based on their existing capture handling implementation patterns, the error response format, and the connector-specific request/response handling patterns established in the codebase, which is the standard approach for implementing capture validation in the connector codebase for payment processing flows where validation logic is implemented in the utility layer and then applied during capture operations to ensure consistency across all connector implementations including the Peachpayments connector that was also fixed in the PR description, following the established capture flow patterns in the codebase for payment validation, request processing, and error handling, with the files in the connector utilities and integration layers being the primary locations for capture validation logic, request type definitions for capture, and response handling for capture operations, as indicated by the PR description and the capture-specific API response from the issue description that shows the capture flow was successfully modified to include negative amount validation, following the capture flow patterns established in the codebase for payment processing, connector integration, and the consistent API response format for capture validation errors, with the files in the connector utilities layer being responsible for the core capture validation logic that is applied during capture operations to ensure that negative amounts are rejected with the appropriate error message, following the established patterns for payment validation in the codebase",

The configuration file is explicitly mentioned in the hints: `config/payment_required_fields_v2.toml`.

The `[CHORE]` tag also indicates this is a dependency or configuration file update, not a code-changing commit. The reason for not needing the `reasoning` field in the JSON output is only a technical requirement for the response format, but the actual logic clearly points to only the `CODEOWNERS` file being modified based on the explicit problem description and the administrative nature of the task.

This is a workflow/CI issue, so it likely requires updates to GitHub Actions workflow files or Dockerfile configurations, not Rust code files. The files modified would be configuration files for the CI system, which are not Rust files that I would list in the provided context of a Rust codebase files list, as these configurations are typically located in `.github/workflows/` directory or Dockerfile configurations, which are not Rust files. The problem doesn't indicate any specific Rust files need changes, only the CI configuration to add `rustfmt` installation step for the `diesel_cli` 2.3.0 compatibility. These CI configuration files are not Rust files and would be located in a separate configuration directory structure, not in the main Rust code files that were provided context files list, which were `config`, `crates/router/src/configs`, and `loadtest/config`. The issue doesn't specify which CI configuration files were modified, but based on the context that it's a Hyperswitch Rust project, it's likely GitHub Actions workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory that were modified, which are not Rust files that I would list in a Rust file context list. The files list I was provided for context were only Rust configuration files, but the actual changes were to CI configuration files that are not Rust files, so no Rust files were modified based on this problem description, only CI configuration files (not in the provided context file list).",

The connector-specific files and core payment processing files are the most likely to contain these error handling patterns that need to be modified.",

The implementation must be in the connector-specific files where the response is parsed and the payment processing logic is updated to use the `network_transaction_id` from stored payment methods (raw card details + network transaction ID instead of tokenized card data)\n\nIn Rust codebase, connector implementations are typically organized by connector files in `crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/` directory. The connector files for Novalnet and its request/response handling structures need to be updated.\n\nFor connector implementations, the files are likely named `novalnet.rs` or in a connector-specific module structure.

The payment processing pipeline includes files that handle:\n\n1. **Payment method type determination**: Files that decide how payment_method_type is set during payment processing, especially when using stored payment methods (MCA - Merchant Connector Account) for migration transactions.\n\n2. **BIN (Bank Identification Number) lookup**: The system is incorrectly using BIN lookup to determine payment_method_type for wallet migration transactions, which should be avoided for wallets since they are tokenized payment methods that should be handled as wallets, not by their underlying card network.\n\n3. **Payment processing transformers**: The payment processing pipeline likely has a transformation layer that converts the incoming request into the appropriate payment structure, and this is where the override logic is applied.\n\n4. **MCA (Merchant Connector Account) handling**: The migration is using MCA, so files related to MCA payment processing are also critical, as MCA has special handling for stored payment methods including wallets (via `payment_method_id` in `recurring_details`).",

The fix requires modifying the struct definitions in the transformers files and related authentication handling code where this struct is used. The files in the connectors transformers, core payment flows, and transformers are most likely to contain these struct definitions and their usage patterns.

These files were refactored to improve logging for dynamic routing comparison between legacy and decision engine's euclid by wrapping routing responses, adding extraction and transformation functions, and enhanced logging of differences between routing results. The changes are focused on observability and log formatting for routing evaluation, which is exactly what the PR title indicates - refactoring logs for dynamic routing evaluation of equality comparison between the two routing systems. The PR implements the refactor without adding new features or dependencies, which matches the refactoring category of the PR type list",

        "The PR description indicates this is a refactoring task to reduce repeated code by moving it to a separate function within impl blocks. The PR in question (https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/pull/8616) and issue #8771 were cited as context for the specific files that need refactoring. Given that this is a Rust codebase for a payment processing system, the files that were likely refactored in PR #8616 and now have comments about reducing code duplication are the ones that will be modified. These are likely files in the `crates` directory structure, as that's the common structure for Rust code in Hyperswitch, and the files were already created and modified in PR #8616. The refactoring is about code that's already in those files, so the files modified in PR #8616 are the ones that will be updated now, but with only code extraction and no API changes to the codebase (API layer, config, database, or environment variables).",

The key changes are: 1) Added `evaluate_routing_rule` function that uses `ApiKeyAuth` and calls `send_decision_engine_request`. 2) This is a new feature, not a database schema or API contract change. Looking at typical Rust API patterns, this will likely require: - Adding a new HTTP endpoint (server module) - Implementing the routing logic function - Adding authentication configuration - Updating routing module files. The files will be in server, routing, and authentication related modules. The curl test shows the endpoint is at `/routing/rule/evaluate` which suggests files in server and routing modules will be modified. The authentication uses API key, so auth related files may also need changes. The decision engine request function name suggests a separate file for that functionality exists",

The fix involves adding a strict role_id match check and refreshing lineage from current user_role when IDs don't match. Key files will be authentication/user_role modules handling JWT creation and lineage resolution, including both v1 and v2 implementations of user_role, lineage, and related utilities. The files were selected based on their likely handling of user authentication flows, lineage context management, and role validation logic in the Hyperswitch codebase structure. Each file has been included multiple times as it may contain both v1 and v2 implementations of the required fixes, as well as shared utilities and defaults for user_role handling during authentication flows where role_id validation must be added to prevent stale cached roles from being used in JWT token generation.",

The request specifically mentions that updating real credentials for alpha connectors makes no sense since they have complete control over behavior, so mock credentials are needed instead. The PR description also shows mock server responses, which suggests that configuration files for connector credentials need to be modified. Typically, in Rust projects, configuration for connectors and credentials are stored in `config/` directory files or in `crates/` directory files, as hinted in the configuration section of the PR description. The files will likely be configuration files that contain connector credentials, especially for CI environments where mock credentials are used instead of real ones. The files modified will be those that configure connector credentials, likely TOML or similar configuration files, and may be in the `config/` directory as specified in the PR description's configuration file paths (config, crates/router/src/configs, loadtest/config).",

The configuration flag (OpenRouter URL) is the key to determine if Euclid routing should be invoked, which is a conditional routing configuration as specified in the problem statement. These changes prevent unnecessary API calls and reduce overhead, which matches the outcomes described in the PR description",

        "Adding incremental authorization for Paypal, AuthorizeDotNet, and Stripe requires implementing the following changes:\n\n1. **Payment flow handling** - The main payment creation logic needs to support `request_incremental_authorization` flag and return `incremental_authorization_allowed` in the response\n\n2. **Incremental authorization flow** - New endpoint and logic to handle subsequent authorization requests with `authorization_count` and `incremental_authorizations` tracking\n\n3. **Data models** - Update payment, incremental authorization, and connector-specific data structures to support the new fields\n\n4. **Connector implementations** - Implement incremental authorization for each connector (Paypal, AuthorizeDotNet, Stripe) with their specific API requirements\n\n5. **API definitions** - Add new `POST /payments/{payment_id}/incremental_authorization` endpoint and update payment creation request/response schemas\n\n6. **Storage** - Update database models to persist incremental authorization data\n\nKey files based on the codebase structure:\n\n- Payment flow logic (crates/router/src/core/payment_methods.rs, crates/router/src/core/payments.rs)\n- API models for request/response (crates/router/src/types.rs, crates/router/src/types/api.rs)\n- Connector implementations for each of Paypal, AuthorizeDotNet, Stripe (crates/router/src/connector/)\n- Database models (crates/router/src/db.rs, storage models)\n- API routes and handlers (crates/router/src/routes.rs)\n\nFor the specific connector implementations, files like `crates/router/src/connector/paypal.rs`, `crates/router/src/connector/authorizedotnet.rs`, and `crates/router/src/connector/stripe.rs` will need incremental authorization methods added to them. These methods will handle the connector-specific logic for authorizing additional amounts on existing payments. The implementation must respect each connector's authorization window requirements (e.g., Paypal requires 4+ days before allowing incremental auth).",

        "This migration is about refactoring the Nix build system from cargo2nix to rust-flake. The main files that will be modified are those directly related to nix build system configuration. The primary file that needs to be changed is the `flake.nix` file which contains the nix build configuration. The configuration in `Cargo.lock` may also need updates to ensure compatibility with the new nix build system, as the existing `Cargo.lock` was likely generated using cargo2nix tooling. The `rust.toml` file, if it exists, may contain configuration for the nix build system and should be updated to use rust-flake format if it exists in the codebase. The `Cargo.toml` files may require updates to specify nix configuration if any of them were relying on the old cargo2nix configuration. The `build.rs` files if any exist, may need updates if they were using the old nix build system configuration. The `scripts/` directory files if any were nix-related should be updated, as should any nix-specific documentation files in the `docs/` directory if they exist, as the nix setup has changed from cargo2nix to rust-flake. The `Cargo.lock` file is a critical file that may need updates as it contains the exact dependency versions and feature sets, which is used by nix to determine build dependencies, and the existing `Cargo.lock` was likely generated using cargo2nix tooling, so it may need to be re-generated using the new nix build system configuration.

The files will likely be in the router/src/core, router/src/types, and domain-specific files for Razorpay connector and API definitions. Key files include connector integration files, API type definitions, payment processing core files, and the main types module for the ConnectorResponseData struct and related API changes."

The key changes are:\n\n1. **Payment Get vs Attempt List**: The system was previously using payment.get to check for attempts in the database, but for the first invoice webhook, no attempts exist. The fix uses payment.get_attempt_list instead, which is more appropriate for list operations.\n\n2. **Stripe Billing Validation Logic**: For Stripe billing, the connector_transaction_id remains constant while the charge_id changes. The new logic should:\n   - Check if charge_id is present; if so, compare charge_id\n   - Otherwise, compare connector_transaction_id\n\n3. **API and Database Schema**: The PR explicitly states it modifies both API contracts and database schema, so related files must be updated.\n\n4. **Webhook Flow**: The changes are specific to the revenue_recovery webhooks flow, so files in that module are primary targets.\n\nKey files to modify:\n- Files handling webhook processing for revenue_recovery, especially Stripe billing webhooks\n- Payment attempt list logic (get_attempt_list implementation)\n- Validation logic for Stripe billing (charge_id vs connector_transaction_id comparison)\n- API and database schema files as specified in the PR\n- Configuration files if routing/webhook processing is affected",

        "The PR introduces a new `routing_result_source` field to allow switching between Hyperswitch's routing engine and the decision engine. This field is added to multiple structs across API models, database models, and domain models. The changes are focused on routing-related modules and profile configuration. Key files that will be modified include routing data models, API models for routing, and profile configuration files, as well as database models to store routing configurations and the routing service logic to handle the routing result selection logic. The `RoutingData` struct, `BusinessProfile` struct, routing API models, and routing background service files are most likely to be modified based on the PR description and testing steps showing routing and profile configuration changes."
