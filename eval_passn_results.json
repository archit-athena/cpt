Looking at the hints and typical structure of Rust projects, especially payment processing systems like Hyperswitch, the changes are likely to involve configuration files and code that needs to be updated for clippy compliance. The paths mentioned in the hints point to config files in 'config' and 'crates/router/src/configs' directories, as well as 'loadtest/config'. Since this is specifically about clippy lints and the PR addresses lint issues, the most likely files to be modified would be the main configuration file for the router (crates/router/src/configs.rs) and potentially the loadtest configuration (loadtest/config/config.toml). These files often contain code that would trigger clippy lints and would need refactoring to comply with the new lint rules in Rust 1.90.0.",
        "The problem statement indicates that clippy lints need to be addressed due to Rust 1.90.0. Clippy lints can occur in any Rust source files (.rs) throughout the codebase. The Hyperswitch project appears to be a large Rust codebase with multiple modules and connectors. Since clippy linting rules can change between Rust versions and may flag different code patterns, we need to check all Rust files for potential lint violations. The most common files that would need updates include core modules, configuration files, connector implementations, and utility modules. Given the scope of the change affecting the entire codebase, a comprehensive check across all .rs files is necessary to address the new clippy lints introduced in Rust 1.90.0.",
        "",
        "",
        "",
        "This is a comprehensive fix for Rust 1.90.0 clippy lints that would affect multiple Rust source files throughout the codebase. The exact files would depend on the specific clippy lint errors, but typically such updates require changes to various .rs files to address new lint rules."

        "The bug indicates that additional amounts (like shipping_cost) are being added again during incremental authorization when they should only be added once during the initial payment creation. Looking at the test case, the initial payment shows amount: 6500, net_amount: 6600 (6500+100 shipping cost), and shipping_cost: 100. After incremental authorization with amount: 6700, it shows amount: 6600, net_amount: 6700, shipping_cost: 100. The issue is that net_amount should be 7700 (6600+100 shipping cost) but it's showing 6700. This suggests the incremental authorization logic is not properly accounting for additional costs that were already included in the initial payment. The files handling payment operations and incremental authorization need to be reviewed to ensure additional amounts are not double-counted.",

        "The bug fix involves changing the refund reason field from Option<String> to a strongly typed enum Option<AdyenRefundRequestReason> in the Adyen connector. This requires: 1) Adding the enum definition in the Adyen connector types file 2) Updating the AdyenRefundRequest struct to use the new enum type 3) Modifying the router code that handles Adyen refunds to convert between the enum and string values 4) Updating refund request/response models to handle the type conversion 5) Possibly updating API handlers for refunds. The Postman test shows that invalid reasons are mapped to 'OTHER', so conversion logic will be needed."

        "The bug report indicates that Cybersource payments via Netcetera are failing for France-based acquirers with Carte Bancaires cards. The fix requires adding four new authentication fields: challenge_code, challenge_code_reason, challenge_cancel, and message_extension for 3DS external authentication.\n\nBased on the codebase structure and the hints provided, the following files are likely to be modified:\n\n1. **crates/router/src/enums/three_ds_authentication_info.rs** - This file likely contains the core 3DS authentication enum that needs the new fields added.\n\n2. **crates/connector-api/src/connectors/cybersource.rs** - Since the issue is specifically with Cybersource payments, this connector file needs the new fields added to its request structure.\n\n3. **crates/connector-api/src/connectors/netcetera.rs** - The issue mentions Cybersource via Netcetera, so the Netcetera connector needs the new 3DS fields.\n\n4. **crates/connector-api/src/connectors/abstract_3ds.rs** - This likely handles abstract 3DS functionality and would need the new authentication fields.\n\n5. **crates/connector-api/src/connectors/payments.rs** - General payment connector logic that may need updates for the new 3DS fields.\n\n6. **crates/router/src/polyfill/lib.rs** - This appears to be a polyfill module that may need updates for the new 3DS authentication fields.\n\n7. **crates/router/src/polyfill/types/three_ds_authentication_info.rs** - This polyfill types file likely mirrors the main 3DS authentication info and would need corresponding updates.\n\nThe changes are focused on 3DS authentication enhancement for external authentication flows, specifically to support the additional fields required for Cybersource/Netcetera integration with French acquirers.",

The fix requires reordering enum variants to prioritize `RefusedResponse` and potentially adding `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` to `AuthorizedResponse` to prevent field conflicts.",
        "Based on the problem description, the issue is with the `WorldpayPaymentResponseFields` enum deserialization in Worldpay connector. The enum incorrectly prioritizes `AuthorizedResponse` over `RefusedResponse` due to variant ordering. The fix requires:\n\n1. Reordering the enum variants to put `RefusedResponse` first\n2. Adding `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` to `AuthorizedResponse` to prevent silent field ignoring\n\nThe main files that need modification are:\n- `worldpay.rs`: Likely contains the enum definition\n- `models.rs`: May contain the struct definitions for response types\n- `error_mappers.rs`: Handles error mapping from Worldpay responses to Hyperswitch errors\n\nThese files are in the Worldpay connector module which handles Worldpay-specific payment processing logic.",

The files selected cover these essential areas for connector integration while following the mentioned directory structure.",
        "The integration of a new payment connector requires configuration files to register the connector (config/connectors/payload.yml, loadtest/config/payload.yml), the core connector implementation (crates/router/src/connectors/payload.rs), updates to connector configuration handling (crates/router/src/configs/connector_config.rs), module exports (crates/router/src/connectors/lib.rs), and likely a global connector list configuration. This follows typical Rust microservice patterns for payment processor integration.",

Connector implementation:\n   - crates/connector-api/src/connectors/payload.rs - Main connector implementation\n   - crates/connector-api/src/lib.rs - Register the new connector\n\n3. Router integration:\n   - crates/router/src/configs/connectors/payload.rs - Router-specific configuration\n   - crates/router/src/connector_api_client.rs - API client integration\n   - crates/router/src/lib.rs - Register router components\n   - crates/router/src/configs/connectors/mod.rs - Module exports\n\n4. Connector API configs:\n   - crates/connector-api/src/configs/connectors/mod.rs - Module exports\n\nThis follows the pattern of other connectors in the codebase where each connector has:\n- Configuration files in config/connectors/\n- Implementation in crates/connector-api/src/connectors/\n- Router integration files\n- Module registration in lib.rs files",

        "The problem statement indicates a bug fix related to routing approach updates in wallet flow. Based on the hints and the problem description, this appears to be a bugfix for handling routing approach updates specifically in wallet payment flows. The fix likely involves modifying wallet-related payment processing logic to ensure the routing_approach column is properly updated in payment_attempt records. Given the nature of the issue and the extensive wallet module structure in the codebase, the fix would likely be in the core wallet payment processing logic, potentially in files related to wallet API services, payment processing, or data models. The ApplePay payment example suggests this affects wallet payment methods and their routing behavior.",
